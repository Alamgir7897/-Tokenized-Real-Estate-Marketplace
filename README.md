# 🏠 Tokenized Real Estate Marketplace

## 📄 Project Description

The Tokenized Real Estate Marketplace is a decentralized platform built on the Stacks blockchain that allows users to tokenize real estate assets, list them for sale, and securely purchase them using STX tokens. Each property is uniquely identified and managed through smart contracts, enabling trustless transactions and ownership transfers without intermediaries.

## 🎯 Project Vision

To transform the traditional real estate industry by leveraging blockchain technology to make property transactions:

- Borderless
- Transparent
- Efficient
- Secure

Our long-term vision is to create a global marketplace where real estate can be owned, traded, and verified digitally with full confidence.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- 🧩 **NFT Integration**: Represent each property as a non-fungible token (SIP-009).
- 🏘 **Fractional Ownership**: Allow users to co-own and co-invest in properties.
- 🕵️‍♂️ **KYC & Compliance**: Integrate identity and legal verification layers.
- 🤝 **Escrow Mechanism**: Use smart contract-based escrow for safer transactions.
- 🗳 **DAO Governance**: Enable community voting for listing approvals and dispute resolution.
